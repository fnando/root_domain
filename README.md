# root_domain

If you ever worked with domain validation, you probably needed to extract the
root domain. This means that, given some hostname, remove subdomains from the original input, taking into account not only official Internet [TLDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain), but. [SLDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain) too.

With root_domain, you can easily extract the root domain, expanding any input from punycode into ASCII entries.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "root_domain"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install root_domain

## Usage

```ruby
require "root_domain"

RootDomain.call("www.example.com")
#=> example.com

RootDomain.call("www.example.com.br")
#=> example.com.br

RootDomain.call("myapp.apps.ðŸ¤¯.com")
#=> xn--oq9h.com
```
